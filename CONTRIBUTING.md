For each issue, please rate it according to its importance and its effort by 1-5 scale in the title. Importance of scale 5 means it is a major bug related to the script functionality or miscalculation. Effort is mainly rated based on the estimated time to complete the issue. If it takes more than a week, rate the effort as 5. Generally, we prioritize solving issue with high importance and low effort. 

So, the title format for the issue is:
> _title_ - IE, for example:
> Inconsistent Energy Generation Calculation by Naomi, Baran, and Tim's script - 43

It means the importance is 4 and the effort is 3.

If it is not a major new feature or takes less than 1 hour of work, use pull request feature directly and add comments in the pull request.
